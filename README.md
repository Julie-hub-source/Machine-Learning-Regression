# Machine Learning Assignments: Regression Models

Welcome to this mini assignment repository that demonstrates two fundamental supervised learning techniques using **Python** and **scikit-learn**:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Logistic Regression**

These assignments were developed as part of my learning journey in Machine Learning, and they showcase hands-on implementation of model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## 1. Linear Regression

**Goal:** Predict a continuous value (e.g., price, score) based on input features.

**Contents:**
- Data preprocessing using Pandas
- Fitting a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn
- Evaluating performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual values

---

## 2. Logistic Regression

**Goal:** Predict a **binary outcome** (e.g., yes/no, pass/fail, spam/not spam).

**Contents:**
- Data encoding and feature engineering
- Training a Logistic Regression classifier
- Evaluating model accuracy and confusion matrix
- ROC curve and precision-recall analysis
